### Description:
For this project, we had to pretend we were a company that was going to design an application that would allow schools to keep track of the students by allowing them to save their information on a database. Within this database the schools could edit this information and allow them to make the changes according to the student and these changes would be tracked across the system. 

As one of the developers, on the project we used VB.Net because this language was easy to understand. Another big point was because the college had taught us this language, so we had to use this in order to complete the project. We also opted for Microsoft Access because we had experience in using it, but I think it would have been better to use SQL Management Studio. But the college computers couldn’t handle these types of software’s. 

This information would also allow them to assess if they need parental consent if they could go on the school trip. The software would split the people who were under 18 and those who were above the age would be on a different database which could be access at any time. It stored the information without clashing those who were under 18 and those who were above.  If they were above 18 then they didn't need their parents’ consent.

### Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio 2017+ (Recommended 2019)
- Windows 10 (OS)
- Microsoft Office (Only Need MS Access)

### Instructions:
- Step 1: Download Visual Studio (If you don't have already)
- Step 2: Clone this project
- Step 3: Once downloading is finished, open it up using Visual Studio
- Step 4: Click run at the top and the application will run
- Step 5: It will launch the application
- Step 6: Change the launch settings from debug to release
- Step 7: Enter information into database and save

### Planned Features:
I will not be making any changes to this project in the feature

### What I learned:
- How to store data using Microsoft Access
- Further understanding of Microsoft Access
- Further understanding of VB.Net
- How to use Visual Studio and connect to a DB

### Constraints:
The application wouldn't save students information and it did only if Visual Studio had the mode set to 'release' instead of 'debugging'. Another constraint was that the application would have a crash handler if it was not set in Visual Studio 2017. So other versions of Visual Studio won't work this this application.

### Improvements:

In this development phrase, I had completed the application but was finishing off the Readme.
