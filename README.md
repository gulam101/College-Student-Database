# College-Student-Database
Student database in VB

What this project is about?

In college we had to pretend that we were a company and had to design an application for a school that tracks their data about the students who are going on a school tripp.
If a student was sick then they had to be informed by the applicaion on the database. If they were underaged then they need permission of the parents.

Techology stack used:
VB and Microsoft Access

We then had to showcase it to other people in the class and they had to pretend to be the school and they would give feedback on the applicaion. They also suggested changes where it was needed.

Since we used VB and Access (Not SQL) they had to have an interface that was simple to use and easy to understand. 

Issues with this project:
The applicaion wouldn't save students information and it did only if Visual Studio had the mode set to 'release' instead of 'debugging'.
