# College-Student-Database

Student database in VB.Net

Description: For this project we had to design an application that would allow the school to keep track of the students by allowing them to save their information on a database. This information would also allow them to assess if they need parental consent if they could go on the school trip. If they were above 18 then they didn't need their parentsâ€™ consent.

We then had to showcase it to other people in the class and they acted like the client. They gave feedback and requested changes to made where necessary.

What I learnt: In this project I learnt how to use Microsoft Access and create a database that would store information. I also improved my knowledge on VB.Net.

Technology stack used:
VB.Net and Microsoft Access

Since we used VB and Access, they had to have an interface that was simple to use and easy to understand. 

Constraints: The application wouldn't save students information and it did only if Visual Studio had the mode set to 'release' instead of 'debugging'. Another constraint was that the application would have a crash handler if it was not set in Visual Studio 2017. So other versions of Visual Studio won't work this this application.
