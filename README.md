### Description: 

For this project we had to design an application that would allow the school to keep track of the students by allowing them to save their information on a database. This information would also allow them to assess if they need parental consent if they could go on the school trip. If they were above 18 then they didn't need their parentsâ€™ consent.

We then had to showcase it to other people in the class and they acted like the client. They gave feedback and requested changes to made where necessary.

### Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio 2017+ (Recommended 2019)
- Windows 10 (OS)

### Instructions:
- Step 1: Download Visual Studio (If you don't have already)
- Step 2: Clone this project
- Step 3: Once downloading is finished, open it up using Visual Studio
- Step 4: Click run at the top and the application will run
- Step 5: It will launch the application
- Step 6: Change the launch settings from debug to release
- Step 7: Enter information into database and save

### Planned Features:
I will not be making any changes to this project in the feature

### What I learned:
- How to store data using Microsoft Access
- Further understanding of Microsoft Access
- Further understanding of VB.Net
- How to use Visual Studio and connect to a DB

### Constraints:
The application wouldn't save students information and it did only if Visual Studio had the mode set to 'release' instead of 'debugging'. Another constraint was that the application would have a crash handler if it was not set in Visual Studio 2017. So other versions of Visual Studio won't work this this application.

### Improvements:

### Development Changes:

- Date: 23/02/20
- Changes: Readme

In this development phrase, I had completed the application but was finishing off the Readme.

### Constraints: 

### Improvements:

This is the improvement section. I order all improvements by an ID which I can refer to at any time and I give a description of what that improvement should be.

- Improvement ID:
- Description: 

For future improvements I think I will go ahead and re-design the interface. Everything seems too small and clustered together and this will make it hard for people to read the application. Also the application can resize but it effects everything on the screen since the interface isn't resized.
